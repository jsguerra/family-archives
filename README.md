# Family Archives Plugin
Family Archives is a plugin which allows for the creation of basic genealogy profiles. You can create page profiles for family members and ancestors with facts, bio summaries and more.

The pedigree is based on 'emperor.js' a Javascript script for embedding pedigree charts into blog posts.
